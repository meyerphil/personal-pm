I remember when we shared our ideas with the class, I felt that my goals were too ambitious. Surprisingly, I was able to turn my idea into a working prototype.<br><br>I feel like this course can be great for anyone willing to learn and put in the effort. This is a true reflection of what a college education should look like, and I do not regret it at all. We trained on how to think like a college student with concepts, industry discussions, and applications of our skills to future technology. It is not a repetitive course where you memorize problems or read a textbook; instead, it is an impactful and extensive learning experience.<br><br>I am very thankful for this opportunity. If there is one thing to remember, 'if you set your mind to big ideas, you can achieve them.' In terms of motivation, 'remember the purpose of college and how it improves you as a person, student, and creator.'"}
