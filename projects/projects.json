            { "type": "text", "header": "4 L's Retrospective", "data": "<b>What did you LOVE about working on this game?</b><br> I loved the research part of the trip. I loved having people try our game out and go through a lot of emotions. I loved working as a team and everyone contributing in their own ways. I loved going from paper design to virtual reality. I love the fact that we have a proper store page, making it so much easier to share and explain what we have been working on to everyone. I love our logo, game name, and studio name as there was a lot of care into creating them.<br><br><b>What did you wish you had, you LONGED for?</b><br> I wish I had more time. There were a lot of things we had to cut out. I wish that some features existed in Unity and OpenXR, there were a lot of limitations and workarounds to get the results I wanted. I wish I had a laptop, working entirely on a desktop at home was tricky. With all the time I spent on campus and commuting back home, a laptop would have saved a lot of time. Playtests could have gone smoother as well because things would have been tested earlier.<br><br><b>What did you LOATHE, you wish you didn't have?</b><br>I wish I didn’t get pneumonia during the later part of the quarter. It really delayed things and we lost a couple weeks. I also loathed how we had to crunch so much. I loathe how long the steam reviewing process is. The unknown and the possibility of delays is very stressful.<br><br><b>What did you LEARN from this?</b><br>I didn’t realize how much I would learn about the parts of a steam train and what they do. I see things much differently everytime I look at a steam train. I learned a lot about the process of publishing a game. I learned how valuable playtests are to confirm a design is working or if there is a problem. I also learned the value of trying our game on different hardware, as there were a surprising number of bugs and compatibility issues despite having the same Windows OS and headset. I didn’t realize how intensive game development is in general. Now I understand why things get delayed in the video game industry so much."},

I remember when we shared our ideas with the class, I felt that my goals were too ambitious. Surprisingly, I was able to turn my idea into a working prototype.<br><br>I feel like this course can be great for anyone willing to learn and put in the effort. This is a true reflection of what a college education should look like, and I do not regret it at all. We trained on how to think like a college student with concepts, industry discussions, and applications of our skills to future technology. It is not a repetitive course where you memorize problems or read a textbook; instead, it is an impactful and extensive learning experience.<br><br>I am very thankful for this opportunity. If there is one thing to remember, 'if you set your mind to big ideas, you can achieve them.' In terms of motivation, 'remember the purpose of college and how it improves you as a person, student, and creator.'"}
