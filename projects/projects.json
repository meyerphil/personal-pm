I loved having people try our game out and go through a lot of emotions. I loved working as a team and everyone contributing in their own ways. I loved going from paper design to virtual reality. I love the fact that we have a proper store page, making it so much easier to share and explain what we have been working on to everyone. I love our logo, game name, and studio name as there was a lot of care into creating them.<br><br><b>What did you wish you had, you LONGED for?</b><br> I wish I had more time. There were a lot of things we had to cut out. I wish that some features existed in Unity and OpenXR, there were a lot of limitations and workarounds to get the results I wanted. I wish I had a laptop, working entirely on a desktop at home was tricky. With all the time I spent on campus and commuting back home, a laptop would have saved a lot of time. Playtests could have gone smoother as well because things would have been tested earlier.<br><br><b>What did you LOATHE, you wish you didn't have?</b><br>I wish I didn’t get pneumonia during the later part of the quarter. It really delayed things and we lost a couple weeks. I also loathed how we had to crunch so much. I loathe how long the steam reviewing process is. The unknown and the possibility of delays is very stressful.<br><br><b>What did you LEARN from this?</b><br>I didn’t realize how much I would learn about the parts of a steam train and what they do. I see things much differently everytime I look at a steam train. I learned a lot about the process of publishing a game. I learned how valuable playtests are to confirm a design is working or if there is a problem. I also learned the value of trying our game on different hardware, as there were a surprising number of bugs and compatibility issues despite having the same Windows OS and headset. I didn’t realize how intensive game development is in general. Now I understand why things get delayed in the video game industry so much."},

I would assume with recommended hardware we wouldn’t notice any improvements besides less noticeable frame dips. <br><br><b>How long is your longest loading time? Where is it and what have you done to reduce it? Is it threaded or does it occur on limited render frames?</b><br> We have loads from Scene to Scene. The longest is from Main Menu to Tutorial, about 0.3 seconds.<br><br>We use Unity’s LoadScene() function. It is not threaded, it is blocking, thus it freezes the game until the next scene is fully loaded.

This is a true reflection of what a college education should look like, and I do not regret it at all. We trained on how to think like a college student with concepts, industry discussions, and applications of our skills to future technology. It is not a repetitive course where you memorize problems or read a textbook; instead, it is an impactful and extensive learning experience.<br><br>I am very thankful for this opportunity.
