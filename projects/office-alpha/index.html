			Another day at the office, another paper to process. Is work truly endless?
			<br><br>Everyone seems tired and out of it. Everyone has lost their soul, literallyâ€¦
			<br><br>Suddenly the souls of fellow co-workers start haunting the workplace! Out of fear of becoming like them, you reach deep into that inner-kid at heart.
			<br><br>With a pen in one hand and a clipboard in the other, put fun back into the workplace! It is your job to send these manifestations of negativity back home.

			To play, a player must:
			<br>- Grab the black pen
			<br>
			<br>EITHER:
			<br>- Creatively draw anything to spawn a 1 health, slow, small 'Doodle'
			<br>- Precisely draw the Triangle or Square to spawn a stronger, faster 'Doodle'
			<br>
			<br>ASSISTANCE:
			<br>- Use the pen to tap the neon buttons above the clipboard to cycle through holographic shape overlays.
			<br>- Shape overlays help assist players in how to draw the precision shapes.
			<br>
			<br>- When the player is ready to spawn their 'Doodle', grab the bottom end of the page and throw it.

			<br>- Where the paper lands, the 2D drawn ink will become a 3D shape, thus a 'Doodle' has come to life.

			<br>- The 'Doodle' will attack the nearest 'Soul', and will lose one health point for each attack.
			<br>- Repeat until you can't handle the endless workplace environment

			<br>
			<br>BONUS: The green pen won't affect the shape recognition, allowing for doodling onto precision shapes.

			I wanted to deepen my VR skills by creating a unique and innovative experience.
			<br> As a game designer, I really want to specialize into the VR space. Looking back, this is the area of game development I share the most experience with.
			<br> With evolving tech and a growing industry, I aspire to create a big VR studio.

		This course I learned the value of fun. Through exploration of unconventional tools and unknown worlds, that is where fun truly is in game design. 

		<br><br>Playing another platformer isn't very exciting, but drawing in a 3D space and seeing your work come to life is something different. In such a sentence, we don't know what to imagine. What are we drawing? How do they come to life? What do they do once they share the same world as you? There are countless examples that we can tune our expectations to when we think of a platformer. How does this compare to Mario? Is this truly worth my time? Is this game better than the other platformers I could play right now?

		<br><br>We all played Minecraft. I remember having so much fun, but that flame dwindled once I explored all there was to see and things weren't new to me anymore. When learning to survive and craft became second nature, not a learning experience, is the point where I checked out for other experiences.

		<br><br>Break normal expectations, break conventional game design, provoke learning, embrace fun.
