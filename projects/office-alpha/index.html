			Another day at the office, another paper to process. Is work truly endless?
<br><br>Everyone seems tired and out of it. Everyone has lost their soul, literallyâ€¦
<br><br>Suddenly the souls of fellow co-workers start haunting the workplace! Out of fear of becoming like them, you reach deep into that inner-kid at heart.
<br><br>With a pen in one hand and a clipboard in the other, put fun back into the workplace! It is your job to send these manifestations of negativity back home.
<br><br><i>(this undisclosed work responsibility of spreading positivity is unpaid)</i>

			Hello! I am currently a fourth-year Computer Science: Game Design Student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In my past years, I have delved my hands into websites and code, committed to collaborative efforts in running a local leadership organization, and contributed to a team environment within playing sports. Today I work in teams creating unique gaming experiences through my innovative designs and educated programming. In my free-time I enjoy football, skateboarding, and video games.
