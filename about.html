			Hello! I am currently a second-year Computer Engineering Student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Throughout the years, I have delved my hands into websites and code, committed to collaborative efforts in running a local leadership organization, and contributed to a team environment within playing sports. In my free-time I enjoy football, skateboarding, and video games.

			I have a twin brother named Dallas. Me and him do everything together, even down to the same degree and classes. Excited to see what cool stuff we can create in the near future.

			My dream is to develop something big that I will feel proud of. Having a career where I can see myself in my work is my goal. I hope to contribute to the world in new research, technology, or applications that relate to my computer engineering field.
