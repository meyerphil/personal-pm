			Hello! I am currently a fourth-year Computer Science: Game Design Student at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In my past years, I have delved my hands into websites and code, committed to collaborative efforts in running a local leadership organization, and contributed to a team environment within playing sports. Today I work in teams creating unique gaming experiences through my innovative designs and educated programming. In my free-time I enjoy football, skateboarding, and video games.

			I have a twin brother named Dallas. Me and him do everything together, down to going to the same university and the same hobbies. I am excited to see what cool stuff we can create in the near future.

			My dream is to develop something big that I will feel proud of. Having a career where I can see myself in my work is my goal. I hope to contribute to the world in new technology or interactive experiences that relate to my game design field.
