			Hello! I just graduated with a Bachelor of Science in "Computer Science: Game Design" at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
			<br>
			<br>
			In my past years, I organized fundraisers and events as Club President in the largest leadership organization 'Kiwanis Key Club.' I have also committed to all sides of the ball in High School Varsity Football. Growing up, teamwork and inspiring others has always been a passion for me.
			<br>
			<br>
			Today I work in teams creating unique gaming experiences through my innovative designs and educated programming. In my free-time I enjoy football, skateboarding, and video games.

			I have a twin brother named Dallas, me and him do everything together. We went to the same university and have the same hobbies. I am excited to see what cool stuff we can create in the near future.

			My dream is to develop something big that I will feel proud of. Having a career where I can see myself in my work is my goal. I hope to contribute to the world in new technology or interactive experiences that relate to my game design field.
